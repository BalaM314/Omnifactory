A guide to the planets in this modpack.
Warning: contains flavor text.

# Sol
Our home system.

Mercury: a barren volcanic world with no atmosphere and low gravity. It orbits extremely close to the Sun and is very hot.

Venus: a superheated volcanic world covered by an extremely thick atmosphere. The oceans are made of sulfuric acid.

Earth: The place we all call home. It has one moon:
- Luna: The moon. No atmosphere and low gravity. Helium-3 and Deuterium can be mined from its surface.

Mars: a barren world slightly smaller than our own. With an extremely thin atmosphere and frigid temperatures, you'll want to bring your spacesuit.

Jupiter: the largest planet in our solar system. It has no surface, so you can only land on its moons(which all have low gravity and no atmosphere):
- Io: This world's core is being heated by Jupiter's tidal forces, and is the most volcanically active in our solar system.
- Europa: An ice-ball world. Recent studies show that there may be liquid water under its surface.
- Ganymede: The largest moon in the solar system, even larger than Mercury.

Saturn: A gas giant famous for its large rings. It has two small visitable moons:
- Titan: A world with an atmosphere so thick you could fly if you had wings. Sadly it's not made of oxygen, and it's freezing cold, but its oceans of oil might make the trip worth it.
- Enceladus: A world similar to Europa, but much smaller.

Uranus: A sideways gas giant with only one visitable moon:
- Miranda: A small moon with extreme terrain. It is home to the tallest cliff face in the solar system[I wish], and the gravity is so low you can jump dozens of meters.

Neptune: A freezing gas giant with only one visitable moon:
- Triton: A mysterious moon, being the only one in the solar system to rotate backwards. Gravity is extremely low.

# Alpha Centauri
The closest star system to Sol. Unlike our own, it has 3 stars. One is hotter than our sun, one is slightly colder, and the third red dwarf orbits extremely far away from the rest. There are 7 alien planets to explore.

## Alpha Centauri A
Novus: A hellish world with a thick, albeit unbreathable, atmosphere. It orbits extremely close to its hot host star, which makes it more scorched than Mercury.

Terra Nova: The best candidate we know of for a second Earth. With a breathable atmosphere, the gravity is negligibly higher, with the same day length. It has some small rings, and one moon.
- Luna Nova: Unlike any moon seen so far, this one is barely habitable. Some sections of it are covered in a jungle. The atmosphere is borderline breathable.

Hubble: A red gas giant with no moons. It has unusually high levels of deuterium and xenon.

## Alpha Centauri B
Proxima B: Not much is known about this world, other than that its gravity is earthlike. Spectral analysis shows an atmosphere of breathable oxygen, but there are large anomalies scattered around the surface. It is in the habitable zone.

Philucka: This world seems to be perpetually covered in storms. The atmosphere is barely not breathable.

## Alpha Centauri C
Proxima C: This world orbits extremely close to its very cold host star. It is a barren volcanic world with no atmosphere.

Kappa: This ice giant is very far from its cold host star, making it the coldest known planet. Almost all of the atmosphere has frozen and fallen to the ground. Warning: high gravity.

# Vita
A star system full of life. Most of the planets here are super earths, with gravity so high you won't be able to jump up a full block without assistance. Make sure to bring a jetpack.

Vita A: A hot, but not scorched, planet covered in mesas. It has 10% more gravity than Earth. The only planet in this system without oxygen. Veins of Stibnite ore can be found here.

Vita B: An alien jungle with high gravity. The atmosphere is breathable. Visitors to this planet should be prepared to encounter lifeforms.

Vita C: A true water world with crushing gravity more than twice Earth's. Our sensors detected low evidence for rings. It has one moon:
- Vita C1: a moon with redwood and birch forests on its surface. The atmosphere is breathable with tolerable gravity.

Vita D: A very large swamp. Gravity is 170% earths, and a space suit is not necessary. This world likely has rings. There is one moon:
- Vita D1: an alien moon. Our sensors detected large quantities of anomalous life forms. Extreme caution is advised.

Vita E: This planet is the farthest out in its system. It has a thin atmosphere, but high gravity. A space suit is not required, although you may get quite cold. There are no moons.

# HD 63776
This star system was picked up by our sensors yesterday. It seems to have 4 planets.
Nothing else is known: go explore it!

# Extremis
Nearly every planet in this star system made us question whether our sensors were malfunctioning. Any trips to this system should be conducted with extreme caution.
The host star is extremely hot.

Igneus: The most insanely scorched world we've ever known. It orbits so close to the host star we're amazed it even exists. It spins at a rate that may cause motion sickness. Large conentrations of osmium and iridium ore were detected below the surface. **Artifact Necessary: 16 Osmiridium Plate**

Halidon: A gas giant with materials that it absolutely should not have. The extremely corrosive atmosphere is full of fluorine, chlorine, and krypton. If there were any moons, they have certainly been dissolved. A large amount of some inert substance will be necessary to warp to this world, lest your space station get corroded into nothing. Teflon might work. **Artifact Necessary: Block of Teflon**

Extremis B: The only planet in this system that is even remotely habitable... except its gravity is nearly 6 times that of earth. Significant terrain anomalies were detected. Large quantities of rutile and molybdenite ore are present.

Irradium: The most ludicrous planet we've ever detected. Our sensors, which we replaced thrice, say that the atmosphere of this gas giant is full of radon and gaseous uranium. Clearly this planet has been heavily irradiated, and shielding is required to warp here. **Artifact Necessary: Shield Upgrade Key** It has one moon:
- Irradon: This moon has been irradiated just as much as Irradium; the entire thing is a nuclear wasteland. It rotates extremely fast. Due to a field generated by extremely strange materials below its surface an exotic material will be required to travel here. **Artifact Necessary: 16 ??**
(hint it's the final gate for omnium)
