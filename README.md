# Omnifactory Tweaked

This is a fork of the Omnifactory modpack created and maintained by BalaM314. It slightly prioritizes ease of automation over balance. You should be able to easily switch your world over to this fork from the **dev version**.

The following major things were changed:
* Added several (Advanced Rocketry) planets. These planets also have a few exclusive ores, for more details see [GuideToThePlanets.md](guides/GuideToThePlanets.md).
* Add back gas mining, which allows Chlorine to be automated (yay!)
* Added Quark
* Make Certus Quartz and Garnet anything automateable, through Vitrified Sand
* Added dogecoin

For the rest of the changes, see [Tweaks.md](guides/Tweaks.md)

This fork *may* also get bug fixes more frequently than main Omnifactory.

Roadmap:
* [ ] Add more elements
* [ ] Add more fun catalyzed recipes
* [ ] Add more fun chemistry
* [ ] Try to make microminers more useful, especially t1mm post tank
* [ ] Add more fun recipes(like the Hyperspace disc recipe)

Original Description:

Omnifactory is a quest-driven, expert-style tech modpack focused on automating large-scale factories. It features a custom take on GregTechCE-centered progression that we hope everyone will enjoy.
