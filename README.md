# Omnifactory Tweaked
This is a fork of the *Nomifactory* modpack created and maintained by BalaM314. It is not affiliated with Omnifactory by Damien Reeve. It slightly prioritizes ease of automation over balance. You should be able to easily switch your world over to this fork from the **dev version**.

The following major things were changed:
* Added several (Advanced Rocketry) planets. These planets also have a few exclusive ores, for more details see [GuideToThePlanets.md](guides/GuideToThePlanets.md).
* Add back gas mining, which allows Chlorine to be automated
* Added Quark
* Make Certus Quartz and Garnet anything automateable, through Vitrified Sand
* Added dogecoin

For the rest of the changes, see [Tweaks.md](guides/Tweaks.md)

This fork is kinda dead but I might merge upstream every now and then

Roadmap:
* [ ] Add more elements
* [ ] Add more fun catalyzed recipes
* [ ] Add more fun chemistry
* [ ] Try to make microminers more useful, especially t1mm post tank
* [ ] Add more fun recipes(like the Hyperspace disc recipe)

Original Description:

Nomifactory is a quest-driven, expert-style tech modpack focused on automating large-scale factories. It features a custom take on GregTechCE-centered progression that we hope everyone will enjoy.

This modpack is based on Omnifactory 1.2.1 by Damien Reave, released in 2019. Exaxxion was appointed the maintainer of Omnifactory in January 2020, and the pack was published on GitHub as LGPLv3 with express permission at that time. Fellow community members wanted to help maintain the beloved pack, resulting in the formation of the dev team and the April 2020 release of "The Community Update".

As of January 2022, that dev team is now the organization, Nomifactory. We are no longer affiliated in any way with Damien Reave or Omnifactory. All assets in this repository have been LGPLv3 since the start of 2020, but out of respect for Damien and his creation we have rebranded all of our work. The Nomifactory name and branding artwork are All Rights Reserved, but everything else is available as usual per LGPLv3.
