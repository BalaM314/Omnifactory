This is a fork of the Omnifactory modpack created and maintained by BalaM314.
The following things were changed:
* Tweaked a few recipes(airtight seal, etc)
* Enabled more of Advanced Rocketry, including gas giant mining, which allows for chlorine automation(it won't be easy)
* Added a lot of fun planets :)
* More coming soon

Original Description:

Omnifactory is a quest-driven, expert-style tech modpack focused on automating large-scale factories. It features a custom take on GregTechCE-centered progression that we hope everyone will enjoy.

This modpack exists thanks to the efforts of Damien Reave, who is the original author and maintainer through version 1.2.1. Exaxxion assumed the maintainer role in January 2020, and is working collaboratively with members of the Omnifactory Discord community to continue development of the pack.
